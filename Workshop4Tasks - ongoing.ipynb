    "### Aims of the workshop\n",
    "Last week we looked at File IO: Opening raw files, reading and writing to them with context managers, and more importantly how we can use the CSV and JSON libraries to read/write File Formats for various purposes. In addition, we briefly explored Numpy as a foundational data structure for numerical computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will explore the Pandas and Seaborn library for Data Analysis and Visualisation. Whilst we won’t be covering everything there is to cover with Pandas ( a lot! ), we can at least begin to utilise it to load in data, and initially explore it. As Seaborn is built on-top of Pandas, that is to say it understands the Dataframe and Series objects from Pandas, we can pass those new objects in to create rich and robust visualisations without worrying about implementation specific details. We will be utilising a lot of concepts which we’ve covered previously, combining them to achieve these visualisations. Along the way we’ll also introduce some miscellaneous concepts which you should now be able to understand, which didn’t exactly fit anywhere before.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept behind this workshop is about discovery, and experimentation surrounding topics covered so far. However, don't forget these exercises are focussed on the material covered in our classes, so you should only use features covered in class in your solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to discuss the work with peers, or with any member of the teaching staff.\n",

    "As always, we should save workshop session in a Notebook in the folder you created on the university OneDrive. Name it something memorable, such as “Workshop 4”."

    "You may need to install Pandas on your person machine, however it has already been installed for you in the DAIM laboratory. If you receive a `ModuleNotFound` error at any point, this indicates the library isn’t installed. You can install this via command-prompt by executing the following: \n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install pandas.\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the library is already installed, but you want a newer version, you can pass `--upgrade` flag to the command. This might be useful.\n",
